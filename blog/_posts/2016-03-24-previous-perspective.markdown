# Digital History

I've been going through old files and organizing my digital past. This includes pictures, videos, miscellaneous documents, and the focus of today's post, writings. There's a lot more of them then I expected; which isn't too surprising considering I was under the influence of something or other for probably all of them.


# Yesterday's Me

The first surprise I did have was not hating every word that I read. As so often has been the case whenever I look back on something I've written (especially computer code), it appears out-dated and disappoints me that such a thing could ever have come from my fingertips. These writings, even though they were written at many different periods of my life, had the distinct feel of authenticity and brought me back to the previous me typing away, trying to convey the inner struggle of coping with existence.


# Forked Versions

Computer projects can be forked, this occurs with open-source code when one programmer creates a copy of another program and continues it in another direction than the main branch. Perhaps this may not be the best way to describe these previous versions of myself, but at the time this current me was nowhere to be found (the idea that I'd be married, 30, and sitting in my own house woulda been laughable) and from that perspective the future me was some guy either dead or living in the woods/on the streets. So we'll call it a fork, a branch of development that thankfully was merged back into the main branch instead of allowed to continue on into the abyss. Here I must thank Kaitlyn for being the vehicle that allowed this to happen. Without her I would be in one of those former outcomes, or worse. In fact, looking back, so many times I would have been stuck if it weren't for the help of others.

The fun part is seeing the world again from that previous perspective. The me that used to be lived in an odd land between reality and imagination, unsure of everything and troubled by the struggle to find a place to survive. It's difficult to accept adulthood when one is 23 years old and in the midst of trying to understand for oneself what is real, what is possible, and what's a fantasy.


# Previous Perspective

The world is a unique place when one's not looking forward, when the foundation for reality is missing and one is afloat in a sea of particles, all appearing to be connected yet so distant that the void between them is fucking palpable. That Kevin was trying hard to understand what it meant to be alive and what it meant to be human. I'm not saying that this one has that all figured out, but rather is too busy looking forward to a family to have the time to contemplate such unanswerable questions. Those questions must be sought when one has the time and inclination to do so, to do otherwise would be a waste of curiosity. One should appreciate curiosity and the ability to explore the questions that have no answer. In the end you are the answer.
