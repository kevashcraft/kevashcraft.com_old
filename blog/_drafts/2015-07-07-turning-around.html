Turning Around

Happy, Happy, No

As I said in the initial post some of these entries will be about feeling unhappy (depressed) and the cycle that I’ve been on that goes from unhappy to happy and back again. Yes, happy and unhappy are very general terms when discussing depression, but I’d bet that you get the idea.

Some Background

May and June of this year were very busy months. Kaitlyn and I moved into our own house on May 1 and spent the next two months getting caught up on bills and unpacking. And while there’s still a mess in the shed and the extra room has a few stacks of my clothes, things are about right; we’ve settled into a routine.

Wednesdays

Wednesdays are like the end and beginning of my week. On Wednesdays I visit my client that I’m writing a program for, get updates, a paycheck, and head home. The days leading up until this day are spent working to get the program updated with the changes we decided upon the prior Wednesday, so it’s always a hill to get over. In addition to the challenge of completing the tasks and looking for his approval, I’m also in search of my paycheck. In prior weeks it’s been a hassle having to either wait a few hours and then meet him somewhere, or actually go to his house to pickup a check. Some weeks he didn’t have one at all and I had to wait until next time for a double check. During all of these occurrences I’ve reminded myself that I work from home and this is the one day of the week that I actually have to put on pants so I shouldn’t be a bitch about it.

On Top of the Hill

Well, two weeks ago we got the paycheck situation straightened out so I know there will always be one when I arrive. Also, the program got past a major hurdle so now development is more stable and less dynamic. These two items may sound great, they did to me. However I quickly started feeling low about everything.

Diets

To keep working and focused I’d drink a lot of caffeine. Then when that stopped being enough I let myself drink Mountain Dew. On top of that, lots of candy and I’d happily finish any meal with a second plate or more (Kaitlyn’s mom and my dad both make some delicious food, not to mention the daily dinners that Kaitlyn makes…). After a few months of this I was gaining weight, about 20 lbs, and while feeling focused after drinking soda, had been sluggish and low the rest of the day. Also, I had been frequently dehydrated which had caused me to stop drinking any alcohol at night, but that’s a whole other tangent.

Low Low

Then last week, after a great Wednesday meeting, I left feeling very low and uncaring about everything. Where was the usual motivation I felt about the next weeks worth of changes? Where was the happiness about going home to Kaitlyn? Where was the feeling of finally being caught up on bills and knowing I had money for the next rent check? It was all fucking history.

Take it Easy

Whenever I’ve been at the apathetic place, low on dopamine and only wishing for some drug-induced escape (that I couldn’t even enjoy this time because even alcohol wouldn’t work in my dehydrated system), I let everything go. The 120mph lifestyle of work and progress that had been me suddenly gets replaced by an idling Kevin who just watches the rest of life coast by, recognizing the unproductivity and silently wishing that death would come and end the need to get going again. So, instead of intoxicants, this past week I played video games, for the first time in years. I did nothing for a week other than sit in this chair and control Gordon Freeman. I fucking love Freeman.

Getting Back

Then, after the 4th of July (Independence Day), I realized I needed to start eating like a guy who was about to turn 30. My dad had a large gut for years around this time of his life and that wasn’t going to be me. Even while I’m with the woman I want for the rest of my life, I still want to be attractive to others, to look in the mirror and feel pride, even at something as vain as my appearance. So, two days ago I stopped drinking soda and started counting calories.

Dopamine

All of this, all of your joy is based on dopamine, that chemical in your brain that says “hey fucker, you’re happy, smile”. It’s a rush whenever you have too much and for some reason I think my brain produces more when it knows it’s about to go without. Whenever I’ve quit smoking I’d have a rush for a few days, and now, having quit drinking soda and consuming about half the calories I had the days before (1,500) I’m on a high all of my own. There may be a bit more to happiness (like the logical realization of where you are in the world and what tomorrow holds), but I know from the times in my life that almost all of it is centered around dopamine.

Tomorrow

So, tomorrow is Wednesday and I’ve spent today being productive and trying to make up for the lost week of work. I’ve been mostly focused from the tea and coffee, but still in a bit of a haze from being hungry and lacking all the yummy high-fructose corn syrup. But, what really matters is that I’m optimistic about tomorrow and looking forward to the rest of today. I’m about to go to the store with Kaitlyn then come home and make dinner. I’m the luckiest man alive and I hope to stay feeling that way.
