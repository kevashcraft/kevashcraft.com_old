Scales

At first I wasn’t sure about getting a scale; it seemed like something that’d just get obsessed over. Then after a few days of wanting to update the app with current weights (and knowing the Publix scale included me plus clothes) I decided to get one. And, do you know what? It’s something that is obsessed over, but not in a bad way. It’s more of a game.

The main motivation for counting calories and working out was not the number on the scale; it was the comfortability of my clothes. I don’t want to have to buy new clothes and I was about to have to since I’m down to 2 pairs of shorts and one pair of pants that fit properly (read: able to button). Because of this, I don’t really care about my weight as a guideline for this venture; it could increase as long as my old clothes fit. What my weight does do is give me something to do. For fun.

It’s fun to see the weight difference between before and after sleeping, eating, running, and pooping. We’re so much more than our attached cells; we’re water, digesting food, and, well I guess that’s all. But it’s fun for me to see the intake and output amounts. It’s
fun to keep this spreadsheet with times and weights and comments. If nothing else than to be one more facet of my life that commits to living healthier.
