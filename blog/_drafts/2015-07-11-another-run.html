Another Run

Numero Dos

I’m sitting here as my body cools down from run #2 and since I’m still to sweaty to start working, I’ll write. This isn’t my second run ever, or probably even my 102nd ever, but it’s number two for this round of personal improvement.

A High

The most enjoyable part of the run for me is right before I start, feeling like I’m athletic and ready for this (until about 30 seconds in when I realize the next 10+ minutes are just something I’m going to have to push through), and the hour or so after I finish. The endorphins running through my brain make me happy and energetic, I tend to text all of my family members and ask how their day’s going, check all the social media, and then end up here writing more thoughts so I don’t just continually inundate those around me with Kevin thoughts. What’s even better about this runners high is the real-life improvement that comes with the feeling. Unlike other highs that require some from of physical/situational degradation (tar on the lungs, financial cost, isolation) this runners high comes with the fact that you’ve just completed something you wanted to do, are in better shape than you were before you started, and have earned eating extra calories for the day.

Calories

Your body is a machine that uses fuel (calories). Give it too many and they’ll be stored for later (that tummy), consume less than you use and you’ll get lean. Maybe one day there will be a device that will track everything you eat and every calorie you burn so you’ll always have an automatic number showing your fuel status. Until that time, it’s fun to scan barcodes and track your own nutrition. There’s a game to be played in living a healthy lifestyle and winning means you feel good and look yummy in a bathing suite.
