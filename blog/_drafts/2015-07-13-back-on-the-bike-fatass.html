Back on the Bike, FatAss

Two Week Later

And I’ve gone for another run. The past 14 days have felt so very busy but I haven’t really gotten anything done. Instead it was more like being weighed down by a task list without the energy and focus to check anything off.

Rain

On of those tasks was mowing the yard. It was already long and every day I would plan on getting it done right after I did some coding (read: scroll through social media and lose hours watching porn), and then it would be the afternoon and in Florida this past month it’s rained everyday, leaving the grass wet and unable to be cut (especially since it was already so long). In the past I would watch the rain, enjoy it while smoking a bowl and letting the day drift by, viewing it like and show and enjoying every minute. Except for the realization that the show will get bad or end if I didn’t put some effort into it.

Walking in a Dream

If productivity was a marker I was trying to walk towards, then everyday it felt like I was making the attempt but that damned marker only slid farther away, moving as more tasks got put on the list and more days went by without others being successfully completed.

Yesterday

It was the first noticeable break in the backslide, which wasn’t very acute itself. Yesterday I went to the dentist and for the first time in my 20’s was not scolded for taking poor care of my teeth, nor informed of the cavities that were there and waiting to be repaired. Nope. I left there with a small bag filled with a toothbrush, paste, floss, and a receipt for the $21 fluoride treatment.

Tall Grass

Yesterday could not have happened if I had not mowed the yard a couple days before, or else I would have gotten home and still had more things that should have been done but were instead still waiting for me to do them. And I’m not saying the past two weeks have been a drag or unfulfilling. They’ve been nice and relaxing, allowing me to spend a day shopping with my mom, a day at the aquarium with my family, a night watching a scary movie with my brother and his significant other, and a day of straight tv because Kaitlyn and I apparently get full-day  hangovers from too much wine. The past two weeks have been like a dream of good people and good times, but they haven’t been productive and that had left me stressed and feeling unaccomplished.

Long Term

I wrote two things on my mirror yesterday. 1) Run/Workout 2) Floss. These two things I want to do every day for the rest of my life. It’s okay if I don’t eat perfectly and it’s okay if I let the yard get too long again (although I really hope I don’t because that turned out to be much more of a bother than ever expected), but if I can maintain those two things I will keep myself from being a fat 30-year old with sore teeth.

Shout-out

Finally, before I go make a protein shake and get started on today’s activities, I need to give myself credit for not drinking soda. A month ago (actually to the date because it was July 4th), I gave myself three things to day (Not Drink Mountain Dew, Juice Everyday, Run/Workout) and of those three I have completed one without fail, I haven’t had any soda. So while it’s not written on the new list, it is still a task and an achievement because I’m not pouring 240 calories a bottle down my throat. Yay!

Hoping

Okay, here’s to hoping I talk to you again tomorrow..
