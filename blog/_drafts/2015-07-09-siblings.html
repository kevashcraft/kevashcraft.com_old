Running

This morning I got up with Kaitlyn and while she went to the gym, I went for a run. It’s a lot more difficult with an additional 20 lbs, but that just means my legs will be used to carrying more once I lose it, right?!

Back to Work

My landlords just left after fixing the well and it’s time to get back to work. Before the arrived and after my run I launched HappilyEverAshcraft.us which still needs a lot of work and probably some content, but the initial install and theme setup is complete. So I’m off to code and maybe write more later. <3
