Hello World

Hello and welcome to the blog of Kevin. I am Kevin.

Today is a Tuesday and I’ll be running the Eagle Net tonight. Kaitlyn and I are about to go to Home Depot to get a water filter and get back a core-charge for a car battery.

Don’t worry, this blog will not be a journal of boring events. Nope. Well, maybe.

The main reason I created this is because I go through depression swings and wanted a good way to keep track of the cycles (they happen every couple of months or so) and I also need a place to write about things. A blog is a great place because nobody reads a blog so I can write just about anything and no one will care or even notice. Horay!
