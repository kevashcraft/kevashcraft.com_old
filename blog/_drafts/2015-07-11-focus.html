Focus

Translation

Full-stack programming is fucking complicated. It’s like translating a conversation between four different people while also being in charge of the table you’re all sitting at. It takes a lot of focus to remember the name the first guy said as you change languages over and over. To remove the analogy, you have to get some info from a database (sql), manipulate it so its in order and ready for the next guy (php), create some boxes to put it in and make them pretty (html+css), then move it all around and put it in the right place (javascript), and the table you’re all working on is your Linux server. All very doable and really awesome, but you do have to focus and think about a whole lot at once (and this isn’t even considered the user-interface side of things to make sure the monkeys understand your boxes).

Mountain Dew

Over the last 6 months I’ve used soda as my focusing agent when coding. Caffeine and sugar are great at keeping you going and giving you the mental energy to think about the whole puzzle at once for hours on end. The only drawback is when you look in the mirror and see the gut that’s formed to hold all those extra calories and your skin zits created from such large amount of high fructose corn syrup. Not to mention the dependency and sluggishness that tag along. So, on Sunday after seeing myself in the mirror Saturday night after all that bbq from Independence Day (my dad got a smoker and made chicken and ribs..) I decided it was time for a change. I stopped drinking the soda.

A Haze

Sunday through Thursday were a haze of fuzziness. I would sit at the computer to work and just stare at the screen, having no motivation to type or focus to think about what I should do or how to do it. I wasn’t going without caffeine; I was still drinking coffee in the morning and even had some tea in the afternoon, but that lack of sugar, not having the continuous injection of the bubbly, delicious soda was truly affecting my work. I considered going back but didn’t want to trade being healthy for being able to work.

At Last

Then, yesterday, I felt clear. I sat down in front of these monitors and knew what to type and could think about how to do it (css is great, but it can take more thought than expected to make a box go where you want, especially if you’re trying to manipulate the scroll bar as well – long story short, you cannot fix a child to its parent but you can move it to a better place). And while I did run out of time because I was up late before and woke up at noon (another fun story), I did write some good code.

Today

I’m about to go take a shower and wash this run away, then see what more I can make. I’ve got some fruit for immediate energy when I feel sluggish and the momentum of this morning. Life goes in swings, from highs to lows, and I’m really hoping this is the beginning of a high and not the end. I hope I write again tomorrow with good news from today.
