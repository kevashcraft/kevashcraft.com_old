<p>I got a new <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/USB-150Mbps-Mini-Wifi-Wireless-LAN-Internet-Adapter-802-11-n-g-b-Network-/331174326267?hash=item4d1b872ffb:g:79MAAOSwPgxVSiLa">wifi usb stick</a> (RTL8188ETV) and wanted to play around with it, but unfortunately when I ran airmon-ng to set the device into monitor mode I learned that the driver for this (r8188eu) didn’t support such activity. So I tried to install the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/8188eu-dkms/">dkms driver from the aur</a>, but that didn’t work either. When I dug further it looks like there was a <a href="https://github.com/jsitnicki/linux/commit/d70efced56a04958a28d1133b201b7b62467ecd7">patch</a> that’s been acceoted into the new kernel (I’m currently running 4.2.5). So, I decided to compile the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-source">Getting the Source</h2>
<p>Where can you find the most recent Linux Kernel? <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Kernel.org</a> is the answer. Kinda. I was, at first, looking to use git and clone the stable branch. In the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/">Git Section</a> I searched for stable and found the stable branch. After a couple of compilations I decided to try the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">dev branch</a> which is a Torvolds Github repo.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-compile">How to Compile</h2>
<p>Next I needed instructions on what to do. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Compilation/Traditional">Arch Wiki</a> gave me a great starting point. I followed it and ran
1. make mrproper
2. zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; .config
3. make menuconfig (set new version number)
4. make
5. sudo make modules_install (failed!)</p>

<h2 id="researching-errors">Researching Errors</h2>
<p>After trying to make modules_install I got the following:
depmod: ERROR: Found 2 modules in dependency cycles!
depmod: ERROR: Cycle detected: lnet -&gt; libcfs -&gt; lnet
Makefile:1139: recipe for target ‘_modinst_post’ failed
make: *** [_modinst_post] Error 1
Which after <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=205322">some researching</a> turns out to be an issue with LNET and can be fixed by disabled the LNET modules in .config. But soon after doing that I realized I should just be compiling the dev branch so that’s what’s making right now (trying it first without disabled LNET for science).</p>

<h2 id="an-update">An Update</h2>
<p>It’s an hour and a half later and I’m still waiting for make.</p>
