Getting Started

The first two weeks you just have to push through. And I’m saying that at the start of my second week.

Pushing Through

This morning’s run wasn’t bad, I went further and faster than before, but I could have easily stopped at any moment. After the first street I took a turn and as soon as the sun shone on me my speed decreased; I felt like my body instantly lost 50% of its energy, or the road was suddenly uphill (it wasn’t).

Right now I’m running ever other day, and I look forward to it because I know I’ll get to sit here afterward on a high and enjoy it while I type. This feeling keeps me going and looking forward to the next day I get to do it again. Last time my high was immediately followed by a low because I got angry over something stupid and spent the next hour calming down (Kaitlyn wanted to juice after her shower and I was expecting we’d do it before. I told you it was stupid.) and was annoyed by having lost the momentum gained from the morning run. I knew it’d be two days before I’d get back that feeling, that speed.

Focus on the High

That’s what you’ve got to find and think about, the instant gratification you’ll receive from the workout. Yeah, we all want to lose weight and look sexier, but that’s long term and can be hard (at least for me) to use as a reason to keep going. But that high, that feeling of mild mania and pride that comes after I’ve reached my stopping point, is my reason to keep going.
